# BioCatalyzer

BioCatalyzer is a python tool that predicts enzymatic metabolism products using a rule-based approach.

BioCatalyzer is implemented as a Command Line Interface that takes as input a set of compounds represented as SMILES
strings and outputs a set of predicted metabolic products and associated enzymes.
